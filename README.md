## Reflection 

In this React side project. I built an application that simulates a shopping website. Firstly we fetch the data of products from the Fake Store REST API, following we can add or remove products in the shopping cart then set the amount and check out. I started this project by using the command `create-react-app` to create the boilerplate, then two additional library `Bootstrap`, `react-router-dom` were installed during the development in this project.  

The technologies implemented in this project including React, React Router, Bootstrap, consuming of REST API and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. Through this side project, I learned about the basic concept of class component with its lifecycle and how to requset different data from the REST API with the built in function, fetch, to make the item of products in our applications more diverse.
